{"name":"logstash","version":"0.12.0","description":"Installs/Configures logstash","long_description":"# <a name=\"title\"></a> chef-logstash [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lusis/chef-logstash.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lusis/chef-logstash)\n\nDescription\n===========\n\nThis is the semi-official 'all-in-one' Logstash cookbook.\n\nThis cookbook is primarily a library cookbook.\n\nWhile you can still use the `agent` and `server` recipes, they are not recommended as they are very limited in what they do.\n\nIf you are using logstash < 1.2 you might want to use the 0.6.x branch.\nIf you are using logstash < 1.4 you might want to use the 0.7.x branch.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nAll of the requirements are explicitly defined in the recipes. Every\neffort has been made to utilize Community Cookbooks.\n\nHowever if you wish to use an external ElasticSearch cluster, you will\nneed to install that yourself and change the relevant attributes for\ndiscovery. The same applies to integration with Graphite.\n\nThis cookbook has been tested together with the following cookbooks,\nsee the Berksfile for more details\n\n* [Heavywater Graphite Cookbook](https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/graphite)   - This is the one I use\n* [Karmi's ElasticSearch Cookbook](https://github.com/elasticsearch/cookbook-elasticsearch)\n* [@lusis Kibana cookbook](https://github.com/lusis/chef-kibana)\n* [Community Beaver cookbook](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/beaver)\n* [elkstack community cookbook](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/elkstack)\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n## Default\n\nsee [attributes/default.rb](attributes/default.rb)\n\n## Beaver (alternative to Logstash Agent)\n\nno longer used.  see [Community Beaver cookbook](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/beaver)\n\n## Source\n\nno longer supports installing from source.\n\nLightweight Resource Providers\n===================\n\nThese now do all the heavy lifting.\n\n## logstash_instance\n\nThis will install a logstash instance.   It will take defaults from attributes for most attributes.\n\nsee [resources/instance.rb](resources/instance.rb)\n\n## logstash_service\n\nThis will create system init scripts for managing logstash instance.   It will take defaults from attributes for most attributes.\n\nsee [resources/service.rb](resources/service.rb)\n\n_experimental support for pleaserun has been added.   Only `native` for `Ubuntu 12.04` has been thoroughly tested._\n\n## logstash_config\n\nThis will create logstash config files.   It will take defaults from attributes for most attributes.\n\nsee [resources/config.rb](resources/config.rb)\n\n## logstash_pattern\n\nThis will install custom grok patterns for logstash.   It will take defaults from attributes for most attributes:\n\nsee [resources/pattern.rb](resources/pattern.rb)\n\n## logstash_plugins\n\nThis will install the logstash community plugins:\n\nsee [resources/plugins.rb](resources/plugins.rb)\n\n## logstash_curator\n\nThis will install the [ElasticSearch Curator](https://github.com/elasticsearch/curator) and setup a cron job. This replaces the deprecated `index_cleaner`:\n\nsee [resources/curator.rb](resources/curator.rb)\n\n## attribute precidence in logstash LWRPs\n\nWe've done our best to make this intuitive and easy to use.\n\n1. the value directly in the resource block.\n2. the value from the hash node['logstash']['instance'][name]\n3. the value from the hash node['logstash']['instance_default']\n\nYou should be able to override settings in any of the above places.  It is recommended for readability that you set non-default options in the LWRP resource block.  But do whichever makes sense to you.\n\nSearching\n======\n\nThere is a search helper library `libraries/search.rb` which will help you search for values such as `elasticsearch_ip`.  see the `server` recipe for an example of its usage.\n\n\nTesting\n=======\n\n## Vagrant\n\n__depreciated in favor if test kitchen.__\n\n```\n$ vagrant up precise64\n```\n\n## Rubocop, FoodCritic, Rspec, Test-Kitchen\n\n```\n$ bundle exec rake\n```\n\n## Test Kitchen\n\n```\n$ kitchen converge server_ubuntu\n```\n\nContributing\n========\n\nAny and all contributions are welcome.   We do ask that you test your contributions with the testing framework before you send a PR.  All contributions should be made against the master branch.\n\nPlease update tests and changelist with your contributions.\n\nDocumentation contributions will earn you lots of hugs and kisses.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nA proper readme is forthcoming but in the interim....\n\nThese two recipes show how to install and configure logstash instances via the provided `LWRPs`\n\n* [recipes/server.rb](recipes/server.rb) - This would be your indexer node\n* [recipes/agent.rb](recipes/agent.rb) - This would be a local host's agent for collection\n\nSee the [elkstack community cookbook](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/elkstack) for a great example of using the LWRPs provided by this cookbook.\n\n\n# Vagrant\n\n## Requirements\n* Vagrant 1.2.1+\n* Vagrant Berkshelf Plugin `vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf`\n* Vagrant Omnibus Plugin   `vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus`\n\nUses the Box Name to determine the run list ( based on whether its Debian or RHEL based ).\n\nSee chef_json and chef_run_list variables to change recipe behavior.\n\n## Usage:\n\nRun Logstash on Ubuntu Lucid   : `vagrant up lucid32` or `vagrant up lucid64`\n\nRun Logstash on Centos 6 32bit : `vagrant up centos6_32`\n\nLogstash will listen for syslog messages on tcp/5140\n\n\n## License and Author\n\n- Author:    John E.
